# Send a Transaction

Now, complete the transaction template below and manually fill in a transfer transaction. This is an exercise to practice completing a transfer transaction on your own.

You can use the `toolbox on the right side` to find the live cells associated with your wallet, to view chain configuration information and to convert between hex and decimal, etc.

### Fill in the transaction information

> **Tip**: Since your live cells are protected by [Omnilock Script](https://github.com/nervosnetwork/rfcs/blob/master/rfcs/0042-omnilock/0042-omnilock.md), the `cellDeps` field should be filled with 2 deps, SECP256K1_BLAKE160 and OMNILOCK. You can find them in the `Chain Info` tool.

<WalletReady>
  <GenerateRawTransaction />
</WalletReady>

After filling it out, click the `Save` button.

### Generate the Transaction Hash

You have filled in all the transaction information manually. Consequently, we are now able to generate a unique hash for the transaction, i.e., we can generate the `tx_hash` beforehand.

To generate the transaction hash, click the button below.

<WalletReady>
  <GenerateRawTXHash />
</WalletReady>

### Sign the Transaction

The transaction used to generate the tx_hash is still a raw transaction. The `witnesses` fileld needs to be filled in with the signature of the transaction for the raw transaction to become a complete transaction structure.

You can put any arguments or proofs you need in the witnesses field. The transaction witness data is used to provide additional arguments or data, such as signatures.
As an array, the witnesses field can include multiple proofs, each one following the structure as:

``` js
table WitnessArgs {
  lock:          BytesOpt, // Lock Script args, which holds the lock-script-related arguments or data
  input_type:    BytesOpt, // Type Script args for input (optional)
  output_type:   BytesOpt, // Type Script args for output (optional)
}
```

This structure is called [WitnessArgs](https://github.com/nervosnetwork/ckb/blob/5a7efe7a0b720de79ff3761dc6e8424b8d5b22ea/util/types/schemas/blockchain.mol#L114-L118), which represents the arguments provided for a transaction witness.

Different locks retrieve the required signature from different fields within WitnessArgs.

The lock field contains the signature to be verified by the locks of the input cells. In our case, this is [OmniLockWitnessLock](https://github.com/nervosnetwork/rfcs/blob/master/rfcs/0042-omnilock/0042-omnilock.md#omnilock-witness) required by the [Omnilock Script](https://github.com/nervosnetwork/rfcs/blob/master/rfcs/0042-omnilock/0042-omnilock.md) algorithm for verification.

The input_type and output_type fields contain the signatures to be verified by the Type Script in inputs and outputs. Feel free to ignore them for now.

> The signing process is tedious. Here is more information: [How to sign transaction](https://github.com/nervosnetwork/ckb-system-scripts/wiki/How-to-sign-transaction)

It's a bit complicated, isn't it?
Don't worry, a one-button operation experience is provided for you to sign the transaction.

First, we need to generate a message.

<WalletReady>
  <GenerateMessage />
</WalletReady>

Second, use your connected wallet to sign a transaction.

<WalletReady>
  <SignTransaction />
</WalletReady>

Third, put the signature back into the transaction. Enter the generated signature in the following input box and click on the button to serialize witnessArgs:

<WalletReady>
  <SerializeWitnesses />
</WalletReady>

Now it is time to finalize the raw transaction by adding the serialized signature to the witnesses field.

<WalletReady>
  <UpdateRawTransaction />
</WalletReady>

### Send the transaction to CKB testnet

<WalletReady>
  <SendTransaction />
</WalletReady>

Note that, after the transaction has been successfully sent on-chain, the tx_hash returned is the same as the one generated beforehand.

This is the certainty of CKB.

You can now check if the transaction we just sent is actually on-chain using the button below. If tx_status is pending, it indicates that the transaction is still under verification. Just retry later.

<WalletReady>
  <CheckBlock />
</WalletReady>

Congratulations, you have successfully completed the CKB Basic Practice Course~.
