# What is a transaction?

## Constructing a transaction is to destroy some cells and create some more

The essence of a transaction in CKB, excluding the less important details, is as follows:

```ts
transaction: inputs -> outputs
```

The essence of inputs and outputs are still some cells：

```ts
inputs:
    some cells...
｜
｜
｜
\/
outputs:
    some new cells...
```

The cells in the inputs must all be live cells. The input cells will be spent and become dead cells after a transaction is committed. The newly created output cells will become new live cells.

## Transaction Rules

1. The capacity summary of all the output cells must be less than the capacity summary of all the input cells:

```
  sum(cell's capacity for each cell in inputs)
> sum(cell's capacity for each cell in outputs)
```

which means that a transaction cannot mint capacities from the air.

2. The difference in capacity between inputs and outputs, is the fee that the miner earns:

```
  sum(cell's capacity for each cell in inputs)
- sum(cell's capacity for each cell in outputs)
= fee
```

You know, miners won't work for nothing. So they collect the difference as a fee.

**Note**:
In practice, for storage optimization reasons, we do not put the complete cell in an input; instead, we just put the cell's index that leads us to the real input cell.
This index structure is called `OutPoint`, which points to a particular cell.

```ts
OutPoint: {
  tx_hash: The hash value of the transaction to which the target cell belongs
  index: The cell position in the transaction to which the target cell belongs
}
```
