# What if the lock code is lost?

So, we know that a lock's code is usually kept in another cell.
What happens if someone destroys that cell? If that cell is spent, the dep cell of a transaction becomes dead, and the lock's code will be gone.
Does this mean that the cell using that lock can no longer be unlocked?

Theoretically, this is true.
Technically, the cell that contains the code of a lock should last as long as the chain, and no one can access this cell.

For [CKB's built-in scripts](https://github.com/nervosnetwork/rfcs/blob/master/rfcs/0024-ckb-genesis-script-list/0024-ckb-genesis-script-list.md), things are simple. Because the cells containing the code of all CKB's built-in lock scripts are inherently inaccessible by anyone.

The lock field of each built-in script code cell is 
```ts
Never unlockable lock: {
  code_hash: 0x0000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000
  hash_type: data
  args: 0x
}
```
which means that no one will ever be able to unlock it, and the code will always be there.

For other scripts, we can still unlock our own cell if the dep cell was destroyed,
because actually we can just redeploy the same lock code to a new cell and then reference the new cell as a dep cell so that you can retrieve the lock code.
