# Difference between lock and type script

Every cell has a lock script. The lock script must run when the cell is used as an input in a transaction.
In addition to the lock script, a cell can also have an optional lock, type script.

These two locks are fundamentally the same, but they are given different names because of their different uses.

**The lock script is usually used to protect the ownership of the box, indicating who can unlock the box,
while the type script is used to ensure that the cell follows certain application logic.**

As cells are transformed from inputs to outputs in a transaction, certain user-defined rules can guide the transformation process.

For example, I want a cell to produce only one new cell at a time in a transaction, I can program such a rule into a type lock of the box.

Another example, I would like a cell to never show the word "carrot" in its data field during a transaction, I could also create a type lock with such a rule.

This is the distinction between the type script and the lock script. 
The former protects the ownership of the box and the latter secures the cell transformation rules.

**The lock script is the gatekeeper, while the type script is the guardian.**

This variance in use comes down to the difference in the design of the two locks in terms of their execution mechanism:

- `Lock script`: In a transaction, the lock scripts run for all inputs by group.
- `Type script`: In a transaction, the type scripts run for all inputs and outputs by group.

**Note**: CKB does not run the script one by one. It first groups the inputs or outputs by script and runs the same script only once.

Due to the variations in execution mechanisms, different suitable uses are derived.
Essentially these are just the recommended official usages.
Of course, you are perfectly free to have your own ideas.
