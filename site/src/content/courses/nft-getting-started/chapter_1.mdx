# Introduction

This guide is intended to help developers get started with NFTs on :term[CKB]. If you want to create and sell NFTs but you are not a developer, then we recommend you visit [NFT Nation](https://nft-nation.live/). This NFT Marketplace will allow you to create and sell NFTs without having to be a developer.

Nervos is a multi-layer ecosystem that currently has two layers. L1 is named CKB, and L2 is named Godwoken. L1 uses the :term[Cell Model] with :term[CKB-VM] while L2 uses :term[EVM]. Because of the differences in their programming models, the NFT standards they use are also very different from each other. The table below lists a few benefits of each for NFT developers.

|CKB L1 Benefits|Godwoken L2 Benefits|
|---|---|
|<ul><li>Cell Model-based NFT standards offer many technical advancements over the older EVM-based NFT standards.</li><li>The CoTA NFT standard has the lowest fees compared to any other decentralized L1 blockchain.</li><li>The Spore NFT standard supports on-chain storage of all data, including image content.</li></ul>|<ul><li>Full compatibility with widely used EVM-based NFT standards like ERC721 and ERC1155.</li><li>More mature documentation, tools, and example code.</li><li>Compatibility with existing NFT bridges and EVM dapps.</li></ul>|

If you want to build on L2 using EVM, please visit the [Get Started with Godwoken](https://docs.godwoken.io/) page. There you will find all the materials and resources needed to build if you are a developer who is already familiar with EVM.

CKB L1 uses template-based smart contracts, meaning a developer can create a new NFT that they control using an existing smart contract instead of having to deploy a new one that does the exact same thing. Using an existing smart contract deployment is recommended whenever possible.

If the existing standards do not suit your needs and you still need to create a new NFT standard, then we recommend completing the courses on [basic theory](/courses/basic-theory) and [practical operation](/courses/basic-operation), followed by the [L1 Developer Training Course](https://nervos.gitbook.io/developer-training-course/). This will help train you on creating smart contracts with the Cell Model, which is a prerequisite to creating a new NFT standard.

For developers who are ready to get started with NFTs on CKB L1, continue to the next chapter where we will learn more about NFT standards.
