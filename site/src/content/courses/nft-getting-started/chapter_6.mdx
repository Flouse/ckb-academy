## Where to Get Help

The best ways to get help are the Nervos Discord server and the Nervos Talk web-based forums.

In the [Nervos Discord server](https://discord.gg/FKh8Zzvwqa), post a detailed question in the `#dev-chat` channel. This channel is checked regularly by members of the Nervos Community and the Nervos Foundation. We will find the answer to your question or find the right person to direct it to, but please have patience since not everyone is available around the clock. If you prefer to use web-based forums rather than Discord, then visit the [Nervos Talk Forums](https://talk.nervos.org/c/english/ckb-dev/32) and post your question under `CKB Development & Technical Discussion`.
