Cells are obtained by the verification of the global consensus on the chain. Owning cells entails costs, since their storage space is limited.

This leads us to the function of CKB's native tokens.

Imagine a cell as a small box that can carry objects. The box itself is created by tokens. A box's size is determined by how many tokens you have.

A box (cell) can also be divided into multiple boxes, as long as the total space of the boxes is equal to the number of tokens you have.
