Welcome to this page! From here, you will learn CKB ahead of everyone else.

In this tutorial, you will learn the basics of CKB, so that you can develop an application on CKB or simply understand them for curiosity's sake.

This tutorial is a complete walk-through that allows you to accomplish the following tasks by yourself:

Build and send the simplest transfer transaction.
Build and send the simplest multi-signature transaction.
Build and deploy the simplest smart contract.
Build and deploy an upgradable smart contract.
To figure it all out, there is:

no need for any local downloads.
no need to run any software.
no need even to write one single line of code!
On this page you can interact directly with the cloud-based test chain in a manual, remote manner.

All you need to have is the patience for reading further down and the curiosity for CKB.

Let's begin this fascinating adventure!
