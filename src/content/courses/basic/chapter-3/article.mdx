Congratulations! Now you are prepared for the tutorial!

CKB is essentially a chain of cells that are constantly being created and destroyed.
A cell is a box that can be used to store all types of data.
To own a cell, you need tokens. The number of tokens equals the size of the cell. 1 CKB = 1 Byte.
The size of the entire cell cannot exceed the value of the capacity field.
To protect your cell, you must put a lock on the cell that only you can open.
It seems that we've got a pretty good grasp of how CKB works. Great! Trust me, you've got most of it figured out. Now, let's get into a bit more detail.
