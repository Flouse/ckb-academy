# Summary 1

Congratulations! Now you are prepared for the tutorial!

- CKB is essentially a chain of cells that are constantly being created and destroyed.
- A cell is a box that can be used to store all types of data.
- To own a cell and store data on-chain, you need tokens: `1 CKB = 1 Byte`.
- The byte size of the entire cell cannot exceed the value of the capacity field.
- To protect your cell, you must put a lock on the cell so that only you or someone you authorize can open it.

It seems that we've got a pretty good grasp of how CKB works. Great! Trust me, you've got most of it figured out. Now, let's get into a bit more detail.
