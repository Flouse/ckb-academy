# What is CKB?
To understand :term[CKB], we must leave behind all the complex concepts and capture the very essence: it's all about cells and the transformation of cells.

:term[Cell] is the basic unit of :term[CKB], similar to a cell in the human body. All the cells constitute the general state of the entire CKB blockchain. When we initiate a transaction on the blockchain, thus making a state change, in the end, for CKB, it is nothing more than spending some cells while creating some new ones, no matter how complicated the transaction and the state change are. This process is the same as the [Bitcoin UTXO](https://developer.bitcoin.org/glossary.html?highlight=utxo).

Unspent cells are `live` cells; spent cells are `dead` cells. So, a CKB chain keeps on spending and creating cells through transactions, just like the renewal and division of cells throughout the body.

> In the CKB universe, countless cells are floating around.
> Cells store data that jointly form the general state of the chain.

Unlike traditional `UTXO`, a cell can store any type of data. Each cell has a field called data, where you can put an
unformatted string. The string can be in whatever format you want, as long as you can interpret it.

For example, the string can be a hash, a text, a date, or even a piece of binary code that can be referenced by
other cells and run on-chain through the CKB virtual machine, :term[CKB-VM].

As simple as that, this is the so-called `smart contract` on CKB.
