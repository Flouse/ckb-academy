# What does a cell contain?

Cells are obtained by the verification of the global consensus on the chain. Owning cells entails costs, since their storage space is limited.

This leads us to the function of CKB's native tokens.

Imagine a cell as a small box that can carry objects. The box itself is created by tokens. A box's size is determined by how many tokens the box has.

A box (cell) can also be divided into multiple boxes, as long as the total space of the boxes is equal to the number of tokens you have.

In Nervos CKB, 1 CKB is equal to 1 byte of storage space.

For example, if you have 100 CKBs, you will have 100 bytes of on-chain space, so you can create a box with 100 bytes of space.

The box can store data. The data size must be smaller than the space of the box, because the box contains other components which also occupy some space.

For instance, one Chinese character accounts for 2 bytes (GBK encoding). If you have 100 CKBs in a cell, you can probably save less than 50 Chinese characters in it.

In the case of Dream of the Red Chamber, this novel is approximately 780,000 words in total, so if you want to upload the whole chunk on-chain, you'll need approximately 1.56 million native CKB tokens.

As you can see, on-chain storage is a precious asset.

CKB stores consensus data on-chain, enabling anyone to upload valuable and necessary data to the consensus. It is comparable to a knowledge base owned by all of humanity.

This is how CKB got its name, `Common Knowledge Base`.

## The entire cell data structure looks like this:

```ts
Cell: {
  capacity: HexString;
  lock: Script;
  type: Script;
  data: HexString;
}
```

### The four fields are defined as follows:

- `capacity`: the space size of the cell, i.e. the integer number of native tokens represented by this cell, usually expressed in hexadecimal. The basic unit for capacity is shannon, 1 CKB equals 10\*\*8 shannon.
- `lock`: a script, which is essentially the equivalent of a lock. We'll show you more details later.
- `type`: a script, same as the lock but for a different purpose.
- `data`: this field can store arbitrary bytes, which means any type of data

> More detailed descriptions of data structures can be found here: [Cell data structure](https://github.com/nervosnetwork/rfcs/blob/master/rfcs/0022-transaction-structure/0022-transaction-structure.md#cell-data)

**Note**ï¼šA cell's total size for all four fields above must be less than or equal to the capacity of the cell. As shown below

```
capacity  = Cell's total space
         >= Sum of the 4 fields' byte length
```

## Example

To get a better understanding of this, let's look at the following example.

Type something as the cell data to see the real-time changes in the length of the cell. Click on the cell to view the cell content and the actual length of each field.

The capacity of the cell is set to 0x1dcd65000 (8,000,000,000 shannons = 80 CKBs), which is 80 bytes in size. If the change in data causes the actual occupancy to exceed the capacity value, the cell will be considered invalid.
