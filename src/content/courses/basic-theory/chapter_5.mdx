# Where is the code actually located?

We have learned that the lock and type fields of the cell are used to lock the box and to guarantee its ownership and control.

A scriptâ€˜s structure looks like this:

```ts
Script: {
  code_hash: HexString
  args: HexString
  hash_type: Uint8, there are three allowed values: {0: "data", 1: "type", 2: "data1"}
}
```

You may notice that the `code_hash` is not the actual code, but some kind of index of the code. This index allows us to retrieve the code. So, where is the code anyway?

The answer is simple: the code is stored in another cell!

We know that the data field of a cell can contain arbitrary data, so we can put the real code in the data field of another cell and implement this cell as a dependency to a transaction. This dependency cell is called `CellDep` (dep cell).

Depending on the value of `hash_type`, `code_hash` has different interpretations:
- If hash_type is "data" or "data1", code_hash should match [blake2b_ckbhash](https://github.com/nervosnetwork/rfcs/blob/master/rfcs/0022-transaction-structure/0022-transaction-structure.md#appendix-a-compute-various-hash)(data) of a dep cell;
- If hash_type is "type", code_hash should instead match [blake2b_ckbhash](https://github.com/nervosnetwork/rfcs/blob/master/rfcs/0022-transaction-structure/0022-transaction-structure.md#appendix-a-compute-various-hash)(type script) of a dep cell.

## The code locating workflow

Please keep in mind that the `code_hash` and `hash_type` fields are used to locate the code. When unlocking a cell, a transaction simply imports the dep cell, and CKB will follow the rules above to find and execute the corresponding code.

So why not just put in the real code, but use this indexing approach?

One of the major advantages of this design is that if everyone needs the same type of lock, the lock code will be identical, and so will the code_hash value. Then it is just a matter of introducing the same dep cell rather than deploying the same code all over again for each case.

## Here's a real example

[Simple User Defined Token (Simple UDT or SUDT)](https://github.com/nervosnetwork/rfcs/blob/master/rfcs/0025-simple-udt/0025-simple-udt.md) provides a way for dapp developers to issue custom tokens on Nervos CKB. It's a widely used type script.

Let's try to find the real code of SUDT type script on CKB testnet:

| parameter   | value                                                                |
| ----------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------- |
|  code_hash  | `0xc5e5dcf215925f7ef4dfaf5f4b4f105bc321c02776d6e7d52a1db3fcd9d011a4` |
|  hash_type  | `type`                                                               |
|  tx_hash    | [0xe12877ebd2c3c364dc46c5c992bcfaf4fee33fa13eebdf82c591fc9825aab769](https://pudge.explorer.nervos.org/transaction/0xe12877ebd2c3c364dc46c5c992bcfaf4fee33fa13eebdf82c591fc9825aab769) |
|  index      | `0x0`                                                                |
|  dep_type   | `code`                                                               |

1. Click the [link](https://pudge.explorer.nervos.org/transaction/0xe12877ebd2c3c364dc46c5c992bcfaf4fee33fa13eebdf82c591fc9825aab769) of tx_hash and jump to the transaction view of CKB testnet explorer;
2. Click the `Cell Info` button of `#0 Output`.

> Look! You found it!

That is to say, if a cell's type script code_hash is set to `0xc5e5dcf215925f7ef4dfaf5f4b4f105bc321c02776d6e7d52a1db3fcd9d011a4`, then that cell will follow the logic of the above code bytes compiled from [simple_udt.c](https://github.com/nervosnetwork/ckb-production-scripts/blob/e570c11aff3eca12a47237c21598429088c610d5/c/simple_udt.c).

But at this point, another question may come to your mind.
