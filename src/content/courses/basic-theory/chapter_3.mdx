# How to tell that you own a cell?

The only way you can possess cells is by owning native tokens, so how do we know which one you own?

Do you remember the lock and type scripts we mentioned above?

If the cell is a box, the lock and type scripts are the two locks on the box.

The lock script is the default lock, and the type script is an optional lock.

In essence, the scripts are a piece of code and parameters. When we try to consume a cell, the scripts will automatically run and enter the parameters and proof we submit (such as the signature) to determine if the locks of the cell can be unlocked. Once unlocked, it proves that we own and control the cell.

The script structure looks like this:

```ts
Script: {
  code_hash: HexString
  args: HexString
  hash_type: either 'data' or 'type'
}
```

In these three fields, hash_type is reserved for later, the other two are:

- `code_hash`: the hash of a certain piece of code
- `args`: the arguments that will be transferred to the code

More data structure details can be found here: [Script data structure](https://github.com/nervosnetwork/rfcs/blob/master/rfcs/0019-data-structures/0019-data-structures.md#Script)

The code_hash and args jointly constitute a full lock: we locate the code to be executed by using the code_hash field and then send the argument args to this code. The code will then be executed by the CKB virtual machine CKB-VM (Additional args may be read during the process, such as the proof attached to the transaction). If executed successfully, a “0” will be returned indicating that the lock can be opened successfully; if not, other values will be returned indicating that the unlocking failed.

With this principle, CKB identifies the owner of a cell, i.e. who can open the lock attached to the cell. The same principle applies to Bitcoin.

We could introduce an asymmetric encryption algorithm via code_hash and place our own public key on the args as an argument. When we need to spend the cell, to initiate a transaction, we could use the private key to sign the transaction so that the cryptographic algorithm could input the public key and signature to figure out whether the corresponding private key initiated the transaction, thus identifying whether it was the real cell owner.

If, on the other hand, you create a cell with a lock that can be unlocked by anyone, meaning anyone can spend the cell, that is spending your money! This is dangerous. Locks are vital to the cell.
