# Summary 2

Congratulations! Now you are prepared for the tutorial!

Let's review all the concepts we have learned:

- CKB is essentially a chain of cells which are being created and destroyed over and over again.
- A cell is a box that can be used to store any type of data.
- To own a cell, you need tokens. The amount of tokens equals the size of the cell. 1 CKB = 1 Byte.
- The size of the entire cell cannot exceed the value of the capacity field.
- To protect your cell, you must put a lock on the cell that only your key can unlock.
- The lock is essentially a piece of runnable code and some arguments. Through entering args and some signatures or proofs provided by the user, the code runs to check if the lock can be opened.
- The return value of 0 means that the lock was unlocked successfully, while any other value means the unlock attempt failed.
- Using the code_hash of the cell, the lock's code can be retrieved. This code is stored in the data field of a dep cell.
- Each cell can carry two locks, one is called lock script (default) and the other, type script (optional).
- In one transaction, the lock scripts of all inputs will be executed once.
- In one transaction, the type scripts of both inputs and outputs will be executed once.
- The differences in the execution mechanism result in different uses for the two locks.
- Lock scripts are often used to protect the ownership of the box.
- The size of the entire cell cannot exceed the value of the capacity field.
- Constructing a transaction is fundamentally about destroying some cells and creating some new ones.

That's right, with the above theoretical knowledge, you're ready to hit the road.

Afterward, we'll have a hands-on experience with CKB!
