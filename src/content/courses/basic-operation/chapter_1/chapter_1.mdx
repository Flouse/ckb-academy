# Connected wallet

Throughout the practical operation course, we will use [CKB testnet](https://pudge.explorer.nervos.org) for all on-chain operations. As a starting point, the first thing we need to do is to connect to the MetaMask wallet.

> In order to ensure the smooth progress of the course, after successfully connecting to the wallet, we will assign 10 `Cells` with a `Capacity` of `100 CKB` to your account.

<ConnectWallet />
<br />
<br />

# Live Cells
The live cells you currently own will be displayed below. If the data cannot be displayed properly, please click 'Fetch Cells' to retrieve the live cell list again.
> When you first connect your wallet, the 10 Live Cells assigned to you will have a 10-second delay. Please refresh the list using the method described above.

<WalletReady>
  <CellsSection />
</WalletReady>


Click on any of the cells above, and you will see detailed information in JSON format.

When we say that a wallet has a certain amount of CKB (the native token), we are actually referring to the sum of the capacity of all the live cells that the wallet can unlock. This is also the total storage space that the wallet can occupy on the chain.

# Blocks

Each square below represents a block, displaying the latest nine blocks on the CKB testnet. The noteworthy information in each block is the transactions displayed in the lower half.

<WalletReady>
  <BlocksSection />
</WalletReady>

When you click on any of the transactions, you will see detailed information in JSON format. You may notice that a real transaction is slightly different from the structure we learned in the theory classes. To be precise, it has become more complex, but it's still graspable if you remember the structure:  `input => output`

If you don't understand what's going on in all these fields for the moment, don't worry, we'll later break it down one by one.

# Testnet Chain
It is also important to know the configuration information of this test chain.

<WalletReady>
  <TestnetConfigSection />
</WalletReady>

`PREFIXï¼šckt` indicates that this chain is the test chain rather than the mainnet.

`SCRIPTS` represent the built-in smart contracts, i.e. some of the system's built-in locks that type and lock can use.

Several built-in smart contracts will be pre-deployed in each CKB chain's genesis block. The following are three of the built-in smart contracts.

- SECP256K1_BLAKE160: the system's default smart contract for the lock script of cells, used to protect the ownership of the cells.
- SECP256K1_BLAKE160_MULTISIG: the multi-signature version of SECP256K1_BLAKE160.
- DAO: NervosDAO contract. Feel free to ignore it if you don't understand.

#### The above information is what we must understand.
In the next section, we will begin to understand the most important components of a transaction.
